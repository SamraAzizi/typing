# Speed Typing Test

This is a simple speed typing test application implemented using the `curses` library in Python. The application displays a random text for the user to type and calculates the Words Per Minute (WPM) as the user types.

## Features

- Random text loading from a file
- Real-time WPM calculation
- Visual feedback for correct and incorrect keystrokes
- Simple and interactive terminal-based interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `curses` library (pre-installed with Python on Unix-based systems)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.

3. Create a `text.txt` file in the same directory as the script. This file should contain several lines of text, each line being a potential text for the typing test.

## Running the Application

To run the application, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then execute the script using Python:

```bash
python main.py
